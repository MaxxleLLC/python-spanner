class KeyRange(proto.Message):
    r"""KeyRange represents a range of rows in a table or index.

    A range has a start key and an end key. These keys can be open or
    closed, indicating if the range includes rows with that key.

    Keys are represented by lists, where the ith value in the list
    corresponds to the ith component of the table or index primary key.
    Individual values are encoded as described
    [here][google.spanner.v1.TypeCode].

    For example, consider the following table definition:

    ::

        CREATE TABLE UserEvents (
          UserName STRING(MAX),
          EventDate STRING(10)
        ) PRIMARY KEY(UserName, EventDate);

    The following keys name rows in this table:

    ::

        ["Bob", "2014-09-23"]
        ["Alfred", "2015-06-12"]

    Since the ``UserEvents`` table's ``PRIMARY KEY`` clause names two
    columns, each ``UserEvents`` key has two elements; the first is the
    ``UserName``, and the second is the ``EventDate``.

    Key ranges with multiple components are interpreted
    lexicographically by component using the table or index key's
    declared sort order. For example, the following range returns all
    events for user ``"Bob"`` that occurred in the year 2015:

    ::

        "start_closed": ["Bob", "2015-01-01"]
        "end_closed": ["Bob", "2015-12-31"]

    Start and end keys can omit trailing key components. This affects
    the inclusion and exclusion of rows that exactly match the provided
    key components: if the key is closed, then rows that exactly match
    the provided components are included; if the key is open, then rows
    that exactly match are not included.

    For example, the following range includes all events for ``"Bob"``
    that occurred during and after the year 2000:

    ::

        "start_closed": ["Bob", "2000-01-01"]
        "end_closed": ["Bob"]

    The next example retrieves all events for ``"Bob"``:

    ::

        "start_closed": ["Bob"]
        "end_closed": ["Bob"]

    To retrieve events before the year 2000:

    ::

        "start_closed": ["Bob"]
        "end_open": ["Bob", "2000-01-01"]

    The following range includes all rows in the table:

    ::

        "start_closed": []
        "end_closed": []

    This range returns all users whose ``UserName`` begins with any
    character from A to C:

    ::

        "start_closed": ["A"]
        "end_open": ["D"]

    This range returns all users whose ``UserName`` begins with B:

    ::

        "start_closed": ["B"]
        "end_open": ["C"]

    Key ranges honor column sort order. For example, suppose a table is
    defined as follows:

    ::

        CREATE TABLE DescendingSortedTable {
          Key INT64,
          ...
        ) PRIMARY KEY(Key DESC);

    The following range retrieves all rows with key values between 1 and
    100 inclusive:

    ::

        "start_closed": ["100"]
        "end_closed": ["1"]

    Note that 100 is passed as the start, and 1 is passed as the end,
    because ``Key`` is a descending column in the schema.

    Attributes:
        start_closed (google.protobuf.struct_pb2.ListValue):
            If the start is closed, then the range includes all rows
            whose first ``len(start_closed)`` key columns exactly match
            ``start_closed``.
        start_open (google.protobuf.struct_pb2.ListValue):
            If the start is open, then the range excludes rows whose
            first ``len(start_open)`` key columns exactly match
            ``start_open``.
        end_closed (google.protobuf.struct_pb2.ListValue):
            If the end is closed, then the range includes all rows whose
            first ``len(end_closed)`` key columns exactly match
            ``end_closed``.
        end_open (google.protobuf.struct_pb2.ListValue):
            If the end is open, then the range excludes rows whose first
            ``len(end_open)`` key columns exactly match ``end_open``.
